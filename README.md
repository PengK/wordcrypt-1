ECE2524 SP14
Final Project

In this project, we are going to build a simple program that
encrypts and decrypts a given string input.

We will show "Rule of Composition" by desining this program
in a way that can be easily connected with other programs.

| xsel -ib                  <-- Or add this to save the result in Clipboard
